# Python Data Science Handbook

Here i'll be saving useful functions / code blocks that can help me in the future in doing nice data science stuff in a simple way.
Think of this as a personal "starred code snipets"

# Code Reference:


## 1- Correlation Matrix:

  ### Description:
  
  The code creates a function that plots a lower triangle correlation matrix with the feature of chosing a minimum correlation coefficient threshold.

## 2- Distribution Plot:
  
  ### Description:
  
  The code creates a seaborn chart with dual axis containing the distribution (with count as stat) and the secondary Y axis is the cumulative distribution shown as percent/proportion of total.
